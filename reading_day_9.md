## Reading Notes Day 9

### Choosing a text editor 
- Choosing your favorite text editor is like choosing which sports team you support. There's no obvious option.
**What is a text editor?** -a text editor is a piece of software you download on your computer that allows you to write and edit text.
**Features to look for** 
1. *code completion*- allows you to start typing and the feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed
2. *syntax highlighting*- takes the text you type and makes it more noticable by colorizing the text
3. *a nice variation of themes*- a variation prevents eye straining and fatigue 
and 4. *the ability to chose from a healthy selection of extensions availible when you need them*- makes it easier to code
